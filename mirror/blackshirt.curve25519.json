    "description": "From wikipedia, Curve25519 is an elliptic curve used in elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) offering 128 bits of security (256-bit key size) and designed for use with the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme. It is one of the fastest curves in ECC, and is not covered by any known patents. The reference implementation is public domain software. The original Curve25519 paper defined it as a Diffie–Hellman (DH) function. Daniel J. Bernstein has since proposed that the name \"Curve25519\" be used for the underlying curve, and the name \"X25519\" for the DH function Curve25519 is an elliptic curve that offers 128 security bits and is designed for use in the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement key design scheme.",
